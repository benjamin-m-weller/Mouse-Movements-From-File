# Mouse-Movements-From-File
This project is intended to be used following running and recording the mouse locations and clicks using my "Get Click Locations" project. I was origionally intending this project to be used in a Runescape bot situation.
I really enjoyed this project. That said, I found that I would be better suited by using other comparable tools to mimic the functionality I wanted for my bot.
